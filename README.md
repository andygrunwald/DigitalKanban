What is DigitalKanban?
-----------------

Hey, welcome to DigitalKanban. But what is it?
DigitalKanban is a small digital Kanban board with multiple users, 
multiple boards and some nice drag and drop features for tickets and columns.

DigitalKanban was created for a small project at my university and one of my wishes was to try Symfony2. 
So here we are. This is my first project created with Symfony2. 
So be patient with me and drop some hints to improve some parts of this application. 
This project could be a example for other Symfony2 starters as i was. 
So, have look and try it. 
If you found some bugs or or have an issue, create a bug ticket here and i will try to help you ;)

This project is based on [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [HTML5Boilerplate](html5boilerplate.com) and there sub projects.

PS: You should use a 'newer' browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (up to date please), 
because DigitalKanban make use of some HTML5 and CSS3 features (i think IE6 or 7 will fail, but i didn`t try it). Thanks ;)
