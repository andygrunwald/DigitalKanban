					Go to the <a href="{{ path('login') }}">login</a>, use 'john' as username and 'admin' as password if you want to walk around as an administrator.
					Use the user 'max' and the password 'user' to see the application as a normal user :)
					Enjoy your testing!

		<h2>What?</h2>
		<p>
			DigitalKanban is a small but simple digital Kanban board.<br />
			Kanban is a widely common lean management method in companies for software development.<br />
			There are few rules to respect, but the rest of the rule set is free to choice and can be adapt to your personal process.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the companies have a physical board in the office. This is a very good way, but has some disadvantages. For example the work on one with distributed teams.<br />
			With DigitalKanban distributed teams can work on one project with one Kanban board together! DigitalKanban isn`t bind to a physical location :)
		</p>
		<p>
			The list of features is quite basic but useful:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Create, edit and delete a unlimited numbers of users</li>
				<li>Two usergroups (Administrators and users)</li>
				<li>Create, edit and delete a unlimited numbers of Kanban boards</li>
				<li>Create and delete a unlimited numbers of Kanbans (single tickets)</li>
				<li>Drag and drop to move the issue through your whole process</li>
				<li>Create and delete a unlimited numbers of columns per Kanban board</li>
				<li>Respect WiP (Limits) per column</li>
				<li>... and much more!</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			DigitalKanban is the result of a project during the third semester at our university <a href="http://www.fom.de/">FOM  - Hochschule f√ºr Oekonomie & Management - University of applied science</a>.<br />
			Our task was to develop a web application in JSP, ASP or PHP with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. What kind of application was free to choose.<br />
			During this time the company where is Andy working introduced the agile project management way "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)" title="Kanban at Wikipedia">Kanban</a>".<br />
			The idea was born. Lets build a small and simple digital kanban board to combine all needs by out professor.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			I have chosen Symfony2, because i always want to try this framework but there was no time during the holidays / out spare time.<br />
			This was the best way and a cool live project to try it.
		</p>
        <p>
            After it was put publicly on github it received contributions from Luis Cordova who is adding various features like manager roles for single board.
